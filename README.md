# markov

A clojure library for generating text using markov chains. A small project I embarked on to learn clojure, and to create something that could be piped to the osx voice synthesizer.

## Usage

Currently it has functions for creating letter frequency maps and to generate text using them. It is not yet a runnable program, but by using the repl one can generate text like the following:
